    <h1>Professional Self-Assessment</h1>
    <p>As a current Platform Engineer, completing the coursework throughout the computer science program and developing
      this ePortfolio has been instrumental in highlighting my strengths, shaping my professional goals and values, and
      enhancing my employability in the computer science field. This ePortfolio showcases my technical skills, while my
      work experience demonstrates my ability to work effectively in team environments, communicate with stakeholders,
      and apply theoretical knowledge to practical problems. Below is a detailed assessment of how my experiences and
      the artifacts included in this portfolio demonstrate my comprehensive skill set.</p>

    <p>Throughout the program, I had to think carefully about effective ways to communicate with stakeholders and
      collaborate in a team environment. These exercises were invaluable, as I communicate almost daily with
      stakeholders on my contracts and must find creative ways to explain technical issues or common pitfalls
      effectively. I continue to learn from these experiences at work, and this CS program has been beneficial beyond
      just technical skills. It has taught me the importance of clear communication, division of tasks based on
      individual strengths, as well as the use of version control systems like Git to manage code collaboratively.</p>

    <p>Outside of coursework, I participated in hackathons where I worked with diverse teams to brainstorm, design, and
      implement solutions within tight deadlines. For instance my team had to work tirelessly for a few weeks to prepare
      our bespoke on prem kubernetes solution for a very important customer. We gathered up some previously used Lambda
      servers and set out configuring all the sys admin stuff like networking and disk raid, as well as K3S which is an
      open source lightweight kubernetes architecture. The biggest challenge was figuring out what I needed to do to
      make our massive GitLab pipeline that deploys our entire infrastructure and AI/ML application to Azure or AWS work
      on our bare metal hardware. These hackathons come up a couple times a year and are a great exercise for becoming a
      well rounded engineer because it’s all up to you, from raid configuration, kubernetes troubleshooting, automation,
      to AI/ML software engineering. These experiences honed my ability to quickly adapt to different roles and
      contribute effectively to team success.</p>

    <p>Most of my experience with data structures and algorithms relates to platform automation pipelines and bash,
      python scripts. These algorithms usually need to search or sort a long list of things like dependencies for
      example, and return some output, and I often need to understand the data structure of the input when I’m
      automating some data retrieval tasks like getting the name of some kubernetes resource using the jq (json query)
      command line tool. This CS program has gone way deeper on algorithms and the machine learning course has been very
      enlightening for an engineer with more of an operations background. Something cool I learned about in this
      program, and which I am on the lookout to implement professionally, is asynchronous data loading and operations to
      avoid blocking the main event thread which increases user interface and experience with the application.</p>

    <p>During this capstone event I enhanced my artifacts to provide better security, which can be as simple as using
      environment variables to store sensitive information such as database credentials instead of hardcoding them, and
      thereby storing them in a repository which is not good practice. This change needs to be accounted for in the
      deployment of the app by using something like a bash script to set up the environment beforehand, which can all be
      done with automation from a pipeline. For software engineering, this program has hammered in the best practices
      surrounding logging configuration for troubleshooting, proper input validation, and error handling. With this I
      have been able to reduce my reliance on rudimentary bash scripts and have been finding ways to use python for some
      of my automation tasks instead, which opens a whole new world of versatility.</p>

    <p>Surprisingly, I haven’t run into databases much in my career to this point beyond just providing postgres, mongo,
      or mysql as part of my kubernetes platform offering to our development teams. This CS program has significantly
      enhanced my skills, providing me with valuable experience in configuring and manipulating both SQL and NoSQL
      databases using CRUD operations for example.</p>
